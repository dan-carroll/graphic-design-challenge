## My 365 Day Graphic Design Challenge

[Dan's 365 Day Graphic Design Challenge](https://dan-carroll.github.io/graphic-design-challenge)

I am a 30 year IT veteran. I have worked in a number of areas of IT including web design. But I am not a graphic designer by any means.

I am a technical type person.  My graphic skills are basically nil. I can take what I find or photograph and modify it. Just basic technical skills.

And this lack of skill was brought to my attention by a young graphics designer. His comment was on my overall skill set encompassing everything to do with web sites except graphics creation. So, time to do something about that lacking skill.

I have heard of other 365 day challenges and even found some about graphics design. So why not give that a try? Will do it with small steps. Work on putting out something new each day for a year.

With life the way it is, though, there will be days when finding the time may not be possible. As long as I can get something new for 5 days out of 7, I will have accomplished my goal of adding to my skill set. This should be fun.

And as an added caveat, I plan on using online tools and/or open source tools. With open source there is also the attraction of possibly being able to contribute. So please follow along and enjoy.
