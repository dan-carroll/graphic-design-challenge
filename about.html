							<strong>This is a Challenge!</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							I had a discussion with a younger colleague of mine about web design and he made an off-hand comment about my skill set. He said that I knew everything about web design except graphic design. That stung.
						</p>
						<p>
							But I guess he was right. I had always considered myself to have an artistic side but I was basically a technical type person. I mean, it does take some artistry to program. Does it not?
						</p>
						<p>
							I have done some graphics work. Mostly acquiring free image off of the 'net or taking some pictures. I could touch these up, combine them, recolor them, resize them, crop them, and assemble something new. Artistic, right?
						</p>
						<p>
							Well, who am I kidding. Time I did something about this lack of skill. And why not now? Here I am under stay-at-home orders because of this wacky 2020 pandemic. All right then, I'm going to do it.
						</p>
						<p>
							So, that's why this site exists. I am going to learn more about graphic design. I am going to make a challenge of it. And I am going to document it on the web. Right here on this site.
						</p>
						<p>
							I had heard of, and seen, other 365 day challenges. It's a pretty cool concept. So, I'll do my own. Dan's own 365 Day Graphic Design Challenge.
						</p>
						<p>
							Here is the idea. I will create a new graphic each day for a year. 365 of them. Well, maybe. Life does tend to get in the way at times. So I will consider it a success if I can do at least 5 days out of seven every week.
						</p>
						<p>
							That seems doable. And to add to the challenge, let's keep it down to using either online or open source tools. Besides, I have some of those already. See, I always meant to do (learn) something about graphic designing.
						</p>
						<p>
							So that is it. Simple concept. Basic rules. Time to get started.
